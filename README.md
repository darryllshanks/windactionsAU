# windactionsAU

`windactionsAU` is a Python package for the calculation of wind loads on structures
in accordance with AS/NZS 1170.2:2021 Structural design actions Part 2: Wind actions.

The package is currently in development. Currently, the package can calculate the 
following:
    - Average Recurrence Interval
    - Regional wind speed
    - Site exposure multipliers
    - Site and design wind speeds

Note that averaging of terrain categories and terrain-height multipliers is beyond
the scope of this package at this time.
